# CourseraIBMDataScienceProject
This holds the project files for one of IBM's Group of courses in the Data Science 'Pathway' on Coursera.

Final Assessed directory has all the screenshots of the question's answers as well as the IBM Watson notebook with the code. The graphs may not work in that notebook so I've uploaded another notebook where they did work outside the directory.
